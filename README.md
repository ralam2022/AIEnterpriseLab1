 IA Enterprise Lab 1 - GitHub Set up

This is a read me file for the AIDI Enterprise Lab 1 assignment in Git Hub

A simple python program adding 2 numbers was created in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded onto a new repository in GitHub.com using GitHub desktop

An attempt was made to use the terminal in Mac however due to file issue permissions the repository could not be accessed via the terminal. Next steps will be to try and resolve the file access issue if possible
